 #### Validator Testing

   - Initially found few errors that where fixed only 2 Warnings left

 #### Deployment 
- When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the Settings tab. The ordering is as follows:

   - heroku/python
    - heroku/nodejs
    - You must then create a Config Var called - PORT. Set this to 8000

    
  -  Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.
